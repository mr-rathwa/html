    <strong>Example :</strong>
    &lt; div <mark> class = "classname" </mark> &gt;  content &lt; /div &gt;

    <br><p>
      An element's classnames are specified by the class attribute. In a style sheet, the class attribute is mostly used to point to a class. Nevertheless, JavaScript may also utilise it to alter HTML components with a certain class using the HTML DOM.

      <br>
      In HTMl the 'id' selector is used as id attribute of element. and futrhermore 'id' is reprsented as unique symbol of (#) and then after id name. hence id should be unique within html page. <br>
      example of id :  <br>

       In HTML 'Class' slector is used as specific attribute. Class seletor starts with (.) and by following Name. Adding to this , class can be  <br>applied multipe times within the page. Important to note that class name can never be numeric.
